I am a big fan of AngularJS and a few months back I started trying React. As React doesn't assume anything about rest of your tech stack it plays well with others. The biggest reason for me to try React was to create isomorphic apps that render on both client and server (with a little help from other libraries as well). In this article I am going to share 10 best reasons to use React in your next project.",

Obviously, the end product won't be as feature rich as Hacker News. But it will be simple and easy to extend. The source code is available on GitHub.",

    "description" : "Immutable.js is a JavaScript library by Facebook that lets you work with persistent immutable data collections. Immutability means once a collection is created, it can't be changed (mutated). With Immutable.js, operations like push, unshift, set etc will return new immutable collections instead of changing the original collection. So, let's see why immutability is useful and explore how Immutable.js lets you write immutable code.",
